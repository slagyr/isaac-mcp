  "Lint for isaac-mcp's own handbook chapter (isaac-q6zb): a backtick
   `config:<dotted.path>` reference (no angle-bracket placeholder inside the
   path) is checked against the composed config schema, and the word right
   after `isaac ` in `isaac <command>` is checked against the registered
   top-level CLI commands. Keep both literal and real when you write one —
   this lint fails the build once either drifts from what Isaac actually
   exposes. `<placeholder>` shapes (e.g. `config:<dotted.path>` itself, or
   `<module-id>#<slug>`) are intentionally skipped. See
   isaac.foundation.handbook-chapter-spec / isaac.hail's
   handbook-chapter-spec for the pattern this follows."
